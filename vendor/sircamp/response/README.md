### new Response
To create new REsponse object ( InfoResponse for example ) you need to have 2 parameters.

A String messaage, that could be empty, and a array named data.

The data array could contain everthing you want, object, string and much more.

+ In case of **InfoResponse** the **type** attribute is setted to **info**
+ In case of **WarningResponse** the **type** attribute is setted to **warning**
+ In case of **SuccessResponse** the **type** attribute is setted to **success**
+ In case of **DangerResponse** the **type** attribute is setted to **danger**


```php

$data = [
    'object' => new Object('example'),
    'number' => 1,
    'string' => "hello world"
    //etc
];

$message = "I want to say hello world";

$infoResponse = new InfoResponse($data,$message);
```
